# Guess-a-number
study program

## Description

 a simple program that generates a random number from one to ten when run, and allows the user to guess that number, if the values are different, the program will inform the user about this and lets him play again, and if the values are the same, the program will also inform the user about it. The user is allowed to play as many times as he wants.

 ## Found challenges

  Finding a way to get the HTML elements from within an Array, and make them return their values when clicked, was my main challenge! My tactic to solve this problem was as follows: 
  - i did precise research on ChatGPT.
  - look for videos related to the methods that were presented to me that I did not yet understood about.
  - and I looked for a little more information about these methods in the documentation.

 In the end I found a much better solution with the first one I made (when I didn't have the necessary knowledge) and I even solved problems in projects I'm developing.

 ## What did i learn?

  - I learned how the target method works, which helped me mainly in click events where there were several child elements.
  - I also learned the functionalities of the matches method, and when should I use it.
  - I also improved a lot in my ability to analyze and solve problems in a critical and constructive way.
